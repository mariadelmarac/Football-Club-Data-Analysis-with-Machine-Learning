# Football Club Data Analysis with Machine Learning

This repository is a work in progress for analyzing football club data and applying machine learning techniques to gain insights and make predictions. The initial focus is on match data for "Cebollitas FC".

## Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess football match data
- Engineer relevant features for analysis
- Explore data visually and statistically
- Prepare datasets for machine learning
- Build and evaluate predictive models (coming soon)

## Current Status

- Data loading and cleaning implemented in `preparation.ipynb`
- Feature engineering and exploratory analysis started
- Interactive and standard train/test splitting available
- Machine learning modeling to be added

## Getting Started

1. **Set up environment (recommended: Anaconda):**
   ```sh
   conda create -n football python=3.12
   conda activate football
   conda install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn notebook ipywidgets
   ```

2. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open and execute the notebooks in order.

3. **Data:**
   - Place your match data CSV in the `data/` folder (e.g., `partidos_cebollitas.csv`).

## Folder Structure

- `data/` — raw data files
- `preparation.ipynb` — data cleaning and preprocessing
- Other notebooks — analysis and modeling (coming soon)
